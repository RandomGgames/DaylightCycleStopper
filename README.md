### What is this
This is a Minecraft data pack that stops the day cycle, weather cycle, and randomTickSpeed when no players are in a world. Works best for multiplayer.

NOTE: This data pack "takes over" the doDaylightCycle, doWeatherCycle, and randomTickSpeed gamerules. I suggest not using any other data packs that utilizes these gamerules as things might behave unpredicatbly.
